            <td>He is the most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky man, Ross is known for being a smart, know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. He is shown to be the most caring of all the six members in the various instances on the show.</td>
            <td>Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. He often mocks his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction</td>
            <td>Joey is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover. He's also a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?"</td>
            <td>Rachel is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likable daughter of a rich vascular surgeon and his wife</td>
            <td>Phoebe is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She is also described as an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street</td>
            <td>Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel and is also described as the mother hen of the group</td>
